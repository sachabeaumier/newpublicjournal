        <h2>Legend of Piwaka</h2>
        <p>
          When Nukutawhiti returned in Kupes canoe to New Zealand it was
          Tiwakawaka who came down to the beach to challenge him, no doubt
          boldly like the fantail. Kupe had seen the fantail, tiwakawaka, on his
          exploratory trip and noted that it carried its tail feathers erect and
          could spread them out like a fan. Its challenging behaviour reminded
          Kupe that he was entering the domain of Tane, god of the forest, and
          perhaps reminded him also of the mythical battle between the sea and
          land birds. Taiaha weapon in hand, the fantail and its companion the
          owl, who was armed with a pouwhenua, advanced towards the forces of
          the sea birds. Fantail got into a towering passion and danced and
          glared and performed all manner of gesticulations. Indeed it is said
          that the war dance, the haka, owes something to this dance of the
          tiwakawaka in mythological times, or at least the single action in it
          of jumping from side to side while brandishing a weapon. It is,
          however, in the stories of Maui that the tiwakawaka plays its most
          important role in Maori mythology. From its refusal to tell Maui where
          his ancentress Mahuika kept fire hidden, it got its very appearance.
          In retaliation Maui took the bird and squeezed it so hard that its
          eyes nearly popped out, hence their prominence now. This also explains
          why its tail projects so far behind its body and why it flies so
          erratically. Let it now be said that the fantail got its revenge in
          full on Maui for his rough treatment by not obeying his instructions
          when it accompanied him on his last and greatest exploit to the realms
          of Hinenuitepo. In those far off days Hinenuitepo, goddess of night,
          goddess of death, lived, as she does today, in the underworld of
          spirits. As mother of mankind she has decreed from the troublesome
          earliest days of creation that man should live one cycle of life, then
          die. Maui wanted to give mankind everlasting life. He sought to kill
          Hinenuitepo and by doing so abolish death forever. When Maui asked his
          father what Hinenuitepo looked like, he replied: “you will see that
          her body is like that of a human being, but is of gigantic size, with
          thighs as red as the setting sun. You will see eyes of greenstone,
          flashing like the opening and shutting of the horizon in summer
          lightening. You will see teeth as sharp as flaked obsidian and a mouth
          like that of a barracouta, and hair like a tangled mass of sea kelp”.
          Maui chose several bird companions besides the fantail to accompany
          him on his great quest. Because he had the ability to change into many
          life forms, he was able to travel with these birds to the underworld
          as a sparrow hawk. Mauis objective was to enter the womb of
          Hinenuitepo when she was sleeping and by passing through her vital
          organs to her mouth, to destroy death. He said to his companions, “My
          command is that when I enter the womb of Hinenuitepo, you must on no
          account laugh.” So Maui, having taken on the form of the noke worm,
          then entered the womb but as he disappeared within, Tatahore, the
          whitehead, burst out laughing whilst the fantail rushed out and began
          dancing about with delight. And then was roused Hinenuitepo who closed
          her legs and strangled Maui and killed him.
